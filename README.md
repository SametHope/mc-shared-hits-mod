Fabric mod to share hits taken by players with all other active players.

---

This is a super simple mod with a single mixin and gamerule. It works on both integrated/LAN and dedicated servers. This mod is only necessary on the server and it will be ignored on clients.

To toggle the mod: `/gamerule shareHits (true/false)` (true by default)
