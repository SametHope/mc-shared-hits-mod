# Minecraft Shared Hits Mod

This is a simple Fabric mod that adds a gamerule to share damage taken by players with all other active players. It works on **single-player**, **integrated/LAN servers**, and **dedicated servers**.

## Gamerule

```
/gamerule shareHits [<value>]
```

- **Default:** `true`
- When enabled, any damage a player takes is also applied to all other active players.
- Only affects **survival mode** players; spectators and creative mode players are ignored.Â 

## Permissions

- Requires **operator permissions (level 2)** or higher to modify the gamerule just like any other gamerule.

## Notes

- This mod is only required on **servers** and will be ignored on clients.
- Works with all vanilla (and probably modded) damage mechanics, accounting for shields, knockback, resistance effects, etc.

## Video Showcase

This video shows an example of how hits are shared and applied to players with different effect and knockback resistances.
